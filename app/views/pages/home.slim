              p First of all we spend some time to analyze everything you need to have in your app. Is your app location based? Do you need server side? Maybe you will need admin panel? Do you need to scale to millions of users? What thrid-party services will you need to use?

              p Then we tailor technical specification for you with breakdown on each feature: authentication and authorization, location services, push notifications, widgets, server side development, third party services, etc. You choose what you need. Maybe that "blue button" that will take a month to develop and which will cost $5000 is not that necessary.

              p App Store release is just the beginning of your journey! When the app takes of - you will need to develop new functionality and improve UX for existing users. Making fitness app? Users will beg you for Apple Watch app. Some company came up with idea of "revolutionary triangle screen"? App Dev Academy will improve your app in every aspect possible.
